shooter
===

OpenGL shooter "game".  "Game" is in quotes because it is a learning project and
should not be expected to be good for anything at all.

Needs (at least):
* GLEW
* GLFW3
* Assimp is in the Makefile, but currently unused.  I expect that I'll need it
when I want to start loading meshes from disk.

Written and compiled on OSX.  Linux shouldn't be a problem, but you're on your
own on Windows.
